The docx module creates, reads and writes Microsoft Office Word 2007 docx files. These documents can be opened in Microsoft Office 2007 / 2010, Microsoft Mac Office 2008, Google Docs, OpenOffice.org 3, and Apple iWork 08.

The docx module supports reading to, manipulating and writing to DOCX files.

Out of the box, you can make Word documents containing paragraphs, bullets, numbered lists, headings, tables, section and page breaks and images. You can also set all sorts of document properties, like author or company.

It's also very easy to do search-and-replace on a document, extract the plain text from a document, add and delete items anywhere in the document. You can also run XPath queries against particular locations in the document â€” useful for retrieving data from user-completed templates.
