Interesting things you could do with ``python-docx``
====================================================

- `LinkedIn Python API<http://code.google.com/p/python-linkedin/>`_ - Auto-build a Word doc whenever some old recruiting dude asks one.
- `Python Natural Language Toolkit<http://www.nltk.org/>`_ - can analyse text and extract meaning.
- `Lamson<http://lamsonproject.org/>`_ - transparently parse or modify email attachments.

Any other ideas? Doing something cool you want to tell the world about? python.docx@librelist.com
